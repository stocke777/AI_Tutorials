00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.360
‘Good morning, I would like to get&nbsp;
my son’s admission here, please’&nbsp;

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:08.560
‘Birth certificate, Aadhar Card, PAN card, Xth&nbsp;

Passport, Life Insurance Policy, Income Tax&nbsp;
Returns, PF, PT and Bank Statements please’&nbsp;

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.520
‘I am sorry, I don’t want to open&nbsp;
a company, just my son’s admission’&nbsp;

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.960
‘Birth certificate, Aadhar Card, PAN card-’
‘Okay, okay! I will get it!’&nbsp;

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.840
‘I assume your kid has a mother too?’
‘Yes?’&nbsp;

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840
‘Hers as well’
‘Jesus-’&nbsp;

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.853
‘Does he have any siblings?’
‘Yeah, a brother’&nbsp;

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:30.320
‘His too’
‘He’s three’&nbsp;

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.960
‘Sign here then’
‘What’s this?’&nbsp;

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.080
‘Document certifying that your second kid&nbsp;
shall be abandoned and shall henceforth&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.840
be in the custody of our Institution’
‘What? No! I will just get it alright?!’

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.320
*48 hours later*

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.120
‘Here you go - every&nbsp;
freaking-damn thing you ordered’&nbsp;

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.080
‘How would you like to pay?’&nbsp;

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.840
‘Er…Cash?’
‘In instalments or in lumpsum?’&nbsp;

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.160
‘How much is it for each?’
‘In instalments it is one lakh per annum’&nbsp;

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.120
‘Oh, that’s not so…bad’
‘With a 135% compound interest rate’&nbsp;

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.960
‘What?’
‘By the end of twelfth year, parents&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.200
usually donate their kidney, liver or an eye’
*silence*&nbsp;

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.960
‘Sometimes both eyes’
‘I will take the lumpsum package please’&nbsp;

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.240
‘That shall be 50 lakhs’
‘Wow, okay…’&nbsp;

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.120
‘Plus, your wife’s dowry’
‘What?’&nbsp;

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.160
‘Plus, GST’
‘Fine! Let me just arrange it okay?’

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.400
*72 hours later*

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.880
‘There! Take everything! Fixed Deposits,&nbsp;
my wife’s jewellery, my childhood&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.760
cricket cards special edition… Everything!’
‘Thank you. Would you like to know what we offer?’&nbsp;

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.200
‘Yes, please…’
‘We offer education from pre-nursery to PhD’&nbsp;

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.520
‘Okay…’
‘Yeah, that’s it…’&nbsp;

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.560
‘What’s the whole system like?’
‘Our system is based on three main principles’&nbsp;

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.200
‘Okay’&nbsp;

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.603
‘1. Rote memorization’
‘Er…’&nbsp;

00:01:46.603 --> 00:01:47.760
‘2. Rote memorization’
*silence*&nbsp;

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.680
‘Would you like to guess&nbsp;
what our third principle is?’&nbsp;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.800
‘Rote memorization?’
‘See? It works’&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.160
‘What about analytical and decision-making&nbsp;
skills? Soft skills, life skills?’&nbsp;

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.160
‘Pardon me for not asking this&nbsp;
question before, but are you stupid?’&nbsp;

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.840
‘What? No. I would… like to think…I am not’
‘THEN STOP ASKING STUPID QUESTIONS!’&nbsp;

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.480
‘Okay, but what about co-curricular activities?’
‘I am sorry what?’&nbsp;

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.880
‘You know, like sports, dance and music’
‘Oh, we give special attention to those as well…’&nbsp;

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.080
‘Good, my son wants to be a Basketball player’
‘But only till the 9th grade. We throw away&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.120
all that by the start of the 10th&nbsp;
standard as students have to focus on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.520
real studies’
‘What? Why?’&nbsp;

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.280
‘Priorities. What would you do if you had&nbsp;
to choose between your dick and your wife?’&nbsp;

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.840
‘That is…not an appropriate analogy’
‘We are simply filling all holes we see…’&nbsp;

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.280
‘Still not appropriate. How&nbsp;
are the exams conducted?’&nbsp;

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.840
‘Exams are divided into four-unit tests, one&nbsp;
half yearly and one final exam, for each class’&nbsp;

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.120
‘Sounds jam-packed’
‘But don’t worry, all these don’t&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.400
matter. The only exam your child has to worry&nbsp;
about are the two Board exams in Xth and XIIth’&nbsp;

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.800
‘What about XIth?
‘We give them false&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.040
hope that the worst is over, so when they&nbsp;
come to XIIth - BANG! Surprise motherfu-!’&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.240
‘Ooookay – what are the variety&nbsp;
of things my son can pursue?&nbsp;

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.480
‘Oh, we have various kinds of streams&nbsp;
for you kid, from science to commerce’&nbsp;

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.960
‘How-how many streams altogether?’
‘Two. Literally science to commerce’&nbsp;

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.120
‘What about Arts?’
‘Pardon me for not asking&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.520
this question before, but are you stupid?’
‘Oh, so we are doing this thing again?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.600
Okay – last question’
‘Yes?’&nbsp;

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.680
‘Will my son get a job?’
‘Oh yes, of course he will!’&nbsp;

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.240
‘That’s great!’
‘We will make sure he does!’&nbsp;

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.000
‘Good…’
‘We will make extra sure he does’&nbsp;

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.920
‘Okay…’
‘We will make extra-extra sure that he does!’&nbsp;

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.640
‘Now you’re just putting too much&nbsp;
pressure… on the… on the ‘extra’’&nbsp;

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.000
‘If your son doesn’t get a job,&nbsp;
how will our system continue?’&nbsp;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.240
‘Huh?’
*laughs*&nbsp;

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.160
‘You’re so naïve, I like that about you!’
‘What are you talking about?’&nbsp;

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.520
‘See, your son will get a job, okay?’
‘Okay’&nbsp;

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.080
‘But only after taking a huge loan from the Bank’
‘But I just paid the lumpsum’&nbsp;

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.840
‘That’s only till 12th. What about college?’
‘I thought you covered that…’&nbsp;

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.360
*laughs*
‘Don’t be silly.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.840
Of course, that is to be paid separately!&nbsp;
That’s our most profit-making portfolio!’&nbsp;

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.920
‘Oh my God…’
‘So, once he is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.200
done getting a job, he will have to work&nbsp;
for the next ten years, paying it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.880
Which means he will have very little savings&nbsp;
left to pursue anything else… Which means,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.480
he will be stuck in the same job, and by the&nbsp;
time he is done repaying it, he will have a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.240
child of his own! And I don’t have to tell you&nbsp;
how much money he would need for that, do I?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.938
He will *laughs* probably have to sell&nbsp;
his soul or something by then *laughs*’&nbsp;

00:04:29.938 --> 00:04:35.280
*nervous laughter*
*laughter&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.160
slowly dies…*
‘Haa….So… any more&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.640
questions?’
‘Er-’&nbsp;

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.080
*phone rings*
‘One second’&nbsp;

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.320
‘Okay’
‘Hello?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.720
Yeah…Uh huh… Okay. Alright, thanks. Bye’
‘Yeah, so I had this one question on-’&nbsp;

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.560
‘Sorry to cut you, but do you remember all the&nbsp;
documents that you submitted at the beginning?’&nbsp;

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.480
‘Yeah…’
‘Yeah, so we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:58.480
found that your Xth Marks card has an extra ‘H’&nbsp;
written on it. So, you will need to correct it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:16.240
cancel everything and start all over again’
‘WHAT THE FUUUC-’
